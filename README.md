# Agriculture- Crop and yield Predictor
Last updated: 2 years ago

## Abstract

We propose an Intelligent Crop Recommendation and Yield prediction system using Machine Learning that predicts crop suitability by factoring all relevant data such as temperature, rainfall, locatio[...]

This system is primarily concerned with performing Agro Consultants principal role, which is to provide crop recommendations to farmer and the expected yield for that crop.

## Our Model:
+ ## Our model first predicts the most relevant crop that can be grown given the solid characteristics namely N(Nitrogen), P(Phosphorus), K(Potassium),Sand the weather of the region namely Temperat[...]
+ ## Then, it focuses on predicting the crop yield in advance by analyzing factors like district (assuming same weather and soil parameters in a particular district), state, season, crop type usin[...]

Datasets:
Two Datasets were used which is present in this Repository .Data-Dictionary and further explanation is in the document. :- https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset
